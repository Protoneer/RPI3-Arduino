# RPI3-Arduino

### Setup_RPI3_Serial.sh
Sets up the the serial pins to point to /dev/ttyAMA0 like on older RPi's. (Needed to make the second script work) 

### InstallArduino.sh
Installed Arduino 1.6.10 with avrdude-rpi in place. (For programming Atmega328 / Atmega2560's connected to the RPI's GPIO with reset Pin on Pin11)
